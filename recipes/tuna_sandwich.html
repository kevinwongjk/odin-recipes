        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I never get tired of an excellent tuna salad recipe, and of the hundreds of versions Iâ€™ve made, this version is the best. Serve on toast, crackers, a bed of greens, or grilled as a very delicious tuna melt.</p>
        <p>No matter how you mix it, making tuna salad at home is one of the easiest, most satisfying meals you can whip up from pantry ingredients</p>

            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic minced</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
